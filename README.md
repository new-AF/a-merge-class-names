## Installation

```bash
pnpm add simple-merge-class-names
```

```bash
yarn add simple-merge-class-names
```

```bash
npm install simple-merge-class-names
```

### Install `Prettier` With VSCode (Most Recommended)

[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

Or install an equivalent auto code formatter for your IDE.

## Usage

Import `mergeClassNames(...args)` from the package, and use it in your JSX or JavaScript code.

```jsx
import { mergeClassNames } from "simple-merge-class-names";

function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <div
            className={mergeClassNames(
                "app",
                "min-h-dvh",
                "grid",
                "grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto]",
                "outline"
            )}
        >
            Hello, world!
        </div>
    );
}
```

While using separate strings for each class name can be tedious, see [Workflow To Minimize Typing Strain](#workflow-to-minimize-typing-strain), it significantly enhances code readability and Developer Experience (DX). This is in contrast to hard-to-read strings like:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <div className="app min-h-dvh grid grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto] outline">
            Hello, world!
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Workflow To Minimize Typing Strain

![Screen recording of optimal DX in action: using this package with Prettier as it neatly arranges each class name on a new line](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/new-AF/simple-merge-class-names/main/.github/images/Reduce%20typing%20strain.gif)

-   Have `Prettier` installed
-   Have `Editor: Word Wrap` enabled in VS Code:

    -   `Open Settings (UI)` â†’ `Editor: Word Wrap` â†’ `on`
    -   Or `Open User Settings (JSON)` and add this entry:

        `"editor.wordWrap": "on"`

-   Use single quotes (<kbd>'</kbd>) for class names, often a single key press on many keyboards.
-   Save the file (<kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd>), and Prettier does the formatting heavy-lifting, it automatically:
    -   Replaces single quotes with double quotes.
    -   Neatly arranges each class name on a new line.

## Why the Mismatch Between Exported Function and Package Name?

I wanted to name the package as `mergeClassNames` to reflect the single exported function, but the NPM Package Registry does not allow capital letters, only lower case and dash characters.

In addition there was already a package named `merge-class-names` but it is no longer maintained (and the developer recommends `clsx` instead).

## Where This Package Excels

While similar packages exist (`clsx`) with better features and potentially improved performance, `simple-merge-class-names` focuses on being very straightforward and easy to reason about, as defined in its source code.

## Source Code

```javascript
/**
 * mergeClassNames - A straightforward utility for merging CSS class names in React + Tailwind, and other JavaScript projects.
 ...
 */

const isTypeString = (val) => typeof val === "string";

const isNotEmptyString = (val) => val !== "";

export const mergeClassNames = (...args) => {
    const space = "\x20"; // " "; ASCII code for single space character;

    const stringsOnly = args.filter((val) => isTypeString(val));

    const trimmed = stringsOnly.map((val) => val.trim());

    const nonEmpty = trimmed.filter((val) => isNotEmptyString(val));

    const className = nonEmpty.join(space);
    return className;
};
```

### Argument Handling

`mergeClassNames` only accepts **_non-empty string values_**, everything else like empty strings (`""`), `null`, `undefined`, numbers, objects and arrays is _ignored_. This ensures stricter and predictable output.

#### Breaking Changes From Version 1.X.X

In pervious versions, arguments that were not strings were implicitly converted to strings by the JavaScript engine.

### Testing

This project uses `Vitest` as the test runner for fast, modern testing.

#### Run All Testing Once

```bash
pnpm test
```

#### Run Tests In Watch Mode

```bash
pnpm test:watch
```

## Production Considerations

If you are considering this package for production, you might also want to look into `clsx` for more advanced features: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx)
